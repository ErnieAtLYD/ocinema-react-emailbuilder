# React Drag and Drop Email Generator
Because I have to learn what the cool kids are doing somehow.

My partner builds weekly email newsletters for his arthouse theater and needed a way to get the content from the CMS into an email template, which takes a bunch of time. This is an (ongoing!) attempt to build that thing. While he will hopefully use it, I'm mostly building this to understand React, since that seems to be [what all the kids are doing](https://littleyellowdifferent.substack.com/p/a-fictitious-somewhat-farcical-conversation) these days.

## Colophon
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). From there we added various libraries such as Material-UI, Redux, React Drag and Drop, Typescript.

For the email templates I used inky-react, a markup language to create HTML email templates with Foundation for Emails.
